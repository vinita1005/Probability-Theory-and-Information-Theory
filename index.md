```

## Probability Density Function (PDF):
Probability over continuous functions.
```markdown

```

## Marginal Probability:
Joint Distribution of several variables can be computed using:
```markdown

```

## Conditional Probability:
Probability of an event, given that some other event has happened.
```markdown

```

# Basic Rules and Terminologies:

## Chain Rule:
```markdown

```
## Independence Rule:
```markdown

```
## Conditional Independence:
```markdown

```
## Expectation:
Average value which f takes on when x is drawn from P.
### Discrete
```markdown

```
### Continuous
```markdown

```
## Variance:
```markdown

```
## Covariance:
Measures how two values are linearly related.
```markdown

```
**Independant variables have 0 covariance.


### Markdown
